    <p style="text-align:center">
        This project will fill a gap by developing multiple sensory technologies involving visual cameras, pressure sensors and IMU sensors
        to provide detailed full body motion capturing of figure skating performance. Through digitizing the skaters'
        performance, and working with national team figure skating coaches, we will develop algorithms and software systems for
        detailed analysis of skaters' movements and use it to guide more targeted personal training. Based on the capturing and analysis,
        the project will further develop algorithms to automatically generate figure skating programs synchronized with the chosen music,
        given the elements that the skaters are capable to perform and obeying all choreograph constraints, to maximize the skaters
        potential scores. Our project involves both graduate and undergraduate students, high school and middle schools students who
        are figure skaters, and national team figure skating coaches. Beyond algorithmic and technology advancements, this project will
        produce key digitized data of figure skating performance that will be valuable for the research community to explore.
